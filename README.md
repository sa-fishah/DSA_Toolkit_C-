# DSA_Toolkit_C++
DSA Toolkit is a Chrome Extension built to make practicing Data Structures and Algorithms easier and more efficient. The main idea behind this project is to help users solve DSA problems faster by giving them quick access to template codes, problem links, notes, and handy tools — all in one place while they’re coding online.

Whether you're solving problems on platforms like LeetCode, Codeforces, or GeeksforGeeks, this toolkit acts like your personal cheat-sheet and productivity booster. It’s designed to be clean, responsive, and super lightweight so you can focus more on logic instead of switching tabs or digging through files.

This project was made to help both beginners and intermediate programmers keep their common DSA resources one click away.
